For the Beginner: Your First Steps to Safe, Automated Trading

The goal here is simplicity, safety, and education. We want to minimize losses while they learn how the market and automation work together.
The "Minimize Losses" Starter Workflow (Using n8n)
This entire process should be done using a paper trading account (like Alpaca's free one) for weeks or months until the strategy is proven.

1. Trigger: Keep it Simple

Tool: n8n Cron Node

Setup: Set it to run once a day, maybe an hour after the market opens (e.g., 10:30 AM EST). This avoids the initial morning volatility.

2. Data Acquisition: Focus on Quality, Not Hype

Tool: n8n HTTP Request Node

Action: Forget penny stocks for now. Start with a single, highly liquid ETF like SPY (S&P 500) or QQQ (Nasdaq 100).

API: Use a free, reliable data provider like Alpha Vantage or Finnhub. Get the last 50 days of historical price data for SPY.

3. Market Analysis: The Simplest Trend Indicator

Tool: n8n Code Node (JavaScript is fine for this)

Logic: Implement a Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover. This is the "Hello, World!" of trading strategies.

Calculate the 10-day SMA.
Calculate the 30-day SMA.
The core logic is: "Is the short-term trend (10-day) stronger than the long-term trend (30-day)?"

4. Decision Making: A Clear Yes or No

Tool: n8n IF Node

Logic:

IF 10_day_SMA > 30_day_SMA -> The signal is "BUY" (or "HOLD if already in a position").
IF 10_day_SMA < 30_day_SMA -> The signal is "SELL" (or "STAY OUT").

5. Trade Execution: PAPER TRADING ONLY!

Tool: n8n HTTP Request Node connected to Alpaca's API.
Action:

If the signal is "BUY", place a paper trade to buy 1 share of SPY.
If the signal is "SELL", place a paper trade to sell any existing shares of SPY.
Crucially: Add logic to prevent buying if you already have a position.

6. Notification & Logging: Your Learning Log

Tool: n8n Twitter/Email Node + Google Sheets Node

Action:

Send yourself a notification: "BUY Signal for SPY executed via paper trade."
Log the trade in a Google Sheet: Date | Ticker | Action | Price. This creates a trade journal you can review to see how your simple strategy is performing.

Leveling Up for Beginners: The Penny Stock Scanner (Not Buyer)
After they've mastered the above, we can address the desire for high-growth stocks responsibly.

Goal: Automatically find stocks that meet speculative criteria and put them on a watchlist for manual review.

Workflow:
Trigger: Cron Node (runs daily).

Data: Use an API from Finnhub or Financial Modeling Prep that has a stock screener.

Analysis/Decision (Code Node): Filter for stocks that meet criteria like:

Price < $5
Market Cap > $50 Million (avoids the absolute worst scams)
Average Daily Volume > 1,000,000 (ensures you can actually sell it)
Price change in last 5 days > 20% (finds stocks with momentum)

Action (Google Sheets/Twitter Node):

DO NOT EXECUTE A TRADE.
Add the list of ticker symbols that met the criteria to a "Daily Watchlist" in a Google Sheet.

Send a Twitter message: "Found 5 potential momentum stocks for review. See your Google Sheet."

This workflow satisfies their desire to find "hot" penny stocks but adds a critical human safety layer, forcing your own research before risking a single dollar.

For the Experienced Trader: Tools to Make Life Exponentially Easier
The pro already has strategies. They don't need us to tell them what to trade, but how to make the process faster, more robust, and less time-consuming.

1. Advanced Triggers: Respond to the Market, Don't Wait for a Schedule

Tool: n8n Webhook Node

Use Cases:

TradingView Alerts: Create complex, multi-indicator alerts in TradingView and have them fire a webhook to your n8n workflow instantly. This offloads the heavy charting/analysis to a specialized platform.
News APIs: Trigger a workflow the instant a news API (like NewsAPI.org) detects a keyword like "FDA approval" or "merger" alongside one of the stocks on your watchlist.
Unusual Options Flow: Connect to a service that can webhook you when there's unusual options activity for a stock, signaling a potentially big move.
2. Multi-Source Data Fusion: Create a Richer Picture
Tools: Multiple HTTP Request Nodes + Merge Node
Action: Don't rely on just price. For a single ticker, pull:
Technical Data from Alpha Vantage.
Fundamental Data (P/E ratio, earnings dates) from Financial Modeling Prep.
News Sentiment Score from a sentiment analysis API.
Use the Merge node to combine all this data into a single, powerful item that your Code node can analyze.
3. Sophisticated Analysis & Risk Management in Code
Tool: n8n Code Node (Python is king here)
Libraries: Use the power of pandas for data manipulation, numpy for calculations, and even ta-lib for a vast library of technical indicators.

Advanced Logic:

Dynamic Position Sizing: Instead of "buy 1 share," calculate position size based on account value and the stock's volatility (e.g., using ATR - Average True Range). position_size = (account_value * risk_per_trade) / ATR.
Portfolio-Awareness: Before placing a trade, use the brokerage API to check your current portfolio exposure. Don't add another tech stock if you're already overweight in the tech sector.
Backtesting Prep: Use the Code node to format historical data perfectly, then pipe it to a local Python script or database to run a proper backtest on your strategy.

4. Dynamic Order Management

Tool: n8n HTTP Request Node (for Brokerage API)

Action: This goes way beyond simple buy/sell.

Trailing Stop Losses: Create a scheduled workflow that runs every 5 minutes, checks the price of your open positions, and programmatically adjusts the stop-loss order to lock in profits.
Scaling In/Out: If a trade is working, the workflow can automatically add to the position at key technical levels.

Order Type Logic: Use IF or Switch nodes to decide whether to use a limit order (to get a better price) or a market order (for guaranteed execution) based on market volatility.

5. Pro-Level Logging & Performance Analytics

Tool: PostgreSQL/MySQL Node or Google Sheets Node

Action: Log everything for performance review.
Trade Log: Entry Date, Entry Price, Signal Source (e.g., 'RSI oversold'), Position Size, Exit Date, Exit Price, P/L, Chart Screenshot URL at time of entry.
Dashboarding: Connect this database or Google Sheet to a BI tool like Metabase, Retool, or Google Data Studio to visualize your strategy's performance, win rate, average gain/loss, and other critical metrics. This turns your trading into a data-driven business.
By splitting the approach this way, it empowers beginners to learn safely and provide pros with the modular, powerful tools they need to scale their expertise.
The Core Integration: Connecting n8n and Apify
This process is the same for everyone. The magic is in what you choose to scrape.

On Apify:

Create an Apify account.
Find a pre-built "Actor" (a serverless scraping bot) for your target site (e.g., "Reddit Scraper," "Twitter Scraper," "Google News Scraper") or build your own.
Get your Apify API Token from your account settings.

In n8n:

Go to the "Credentials" section and add new credentials for "Apify." Paste your API token here.
In your workflow, add the Apify Node.

Configure the node:

Resource: Actor

Operation: Run Actor and Get Dataset Items (This tells n8n to start the scraper and wait for it to finish before moving on).

Actor/Task ID: Paste the ID of the Apify Actor you want to run (e.g., apify/google-news-scraper).

Input Body: This is where you tell the scraper what to do, using JSON. For example, for a news scraper, you might provide: {"search": "Tesla Inc"}.
The Apify node will now execute, run the scrape, and pass the results (e.g., a list of news articles, tweets, or Reddit posts) as clean JSON data to the next node in your workflow. This node slots perfectly into Phase 2: Data Acquisition.

For the Beginner: Using Scraping as a "Hype & Hype & Volatility Detector"

The goal is not to trade based on scraped data directly. It's to learn about market sentiment and identify stocks that might be highly volatile, which beginners should often avoid or study from a safe distance.
The "Social Media Buzz" Scanner Workflow

This workflow automatically alerts you when a stock is getting an unusual amount of attention online.
Trigger: Cron Node (e.g., runs every hour).

Data Acquisition (The New Part):

Tool: Apify Node
Action: Configure it to use a Reddit Scraper Actor.
Input: Tell it to scrape the top 50 posts from the r/wallstreetbets subreddit.
Market Analysis:
Tool: Code Node (JavaScript)

Logic:

You'll get a list of posts from Apify. Loop through the title and selftext of each post.
Create a list of common stock tickers you want to monitor (e.g., ['GME', 'AMC', 'TSLA', 'PLTR']).
Count how many times each ticker is mentioned.
Output a list of tickers and their mention counts. For example: [{ "ticker": "TSLA", "mentions": 15 }, { "ticker": "GME", "mentions": 3 }].
Decision Making:
Tool: IF Node
Logic: IF mentions > 10 (or some other threshold you set). This filters for only the stocks that are being talked about heavily.

Notification (The Learning Tool):

Tool: Twitter/Email Node

Action: DO NOT EXECUTE A TRADE. Send an alert for research purposes.

Message: "High Social Media Alert: TSLA was mentioned 15 times on r/wallstreetbets in the last hour. Expect potential high volatility. For research only."
This teaches the beginner about the relationship between social media hype and market volatility without risking any capital. It's a powerful tool for situational awareness.

For the Experienced Trader: Creating "Alpha" with Alternative Data
For pros, scraping is about finding an information edge that others don't have. This involves fusing scraped "alt data" with traditional technical or fundamental data to create high-confidence signals.
Advanced Workflow 1: Insider Trading Signal

Goal: Get alerted when a corporate insider makes a significant purchase of their own company's stock.
Workflow:

Trigger: Cron Node (runs daily).
Data Acquisition (Apify Node): Use a scraper for the SEC EDGAR database to find new Form 4 filings. Filter for "Acquisition (A)" transactions.
Analysis (Code Node): Process the results. Extract the Ticker, Insider's Name/Role (e.g., "CEO"), and transaction size.
Decision (IF Node): IF (Role == 'CEO' OR Role == 'CFO') AND (Transaction_Value > $100,000).

Action (Telegram/HTTP Request):

Send a high-priority alert: "Insider Alert: CEO of
        XYZ∗∗justpurchased∗∗XYZ** just purchased **XYZ∗∗justpurchased∗∗
     
 150,000 worth of stock."
This could even trigger another part of the workflow to pull up a chart and technicals for $XYZ for immediate review.
Advanced Workflow 2: News Sentiment & Technical Crossover
Goal: Combine a positive news catalyst with a technically "oversold" condition to find powerful reversal opportunities.
Workflow:
Trigger: Cron Node (runs every 15 minutes during market hours).
Get Watchlist: Google Sheets or Database Node to pull your list of monitored stocks.
Loop: Use a Split in Batches node to process one stock at a time.
Data Acquisition (Parallel Branches):
Branch A (Alt Data): Apify Node -> Use Google News Scraper. Input the stock's name.
Branch B (Technical Data): HTTP Request Node -> Use Alpha Vantage to get the latest price and calculate the RSI (Relative Strength Index).
Merge & Analyze:
Merge Node: Combine the news data and technical data.
Code Node (Python/JS):
Analyze the sentiment of the news headlines scraped by Apify. Look for keywords like "upgrade," "beats earnings," "partnership," "positive trial results." Assign a sentiment score (e.g., +1 for positive, 0 for neutral).
Check the technical data from Branch B for the RSI value.
Decision (IF Node): This is where the magic happens.
Logic: IF (RSI < 30) AND (Sentiment_Score > 0)
Action (HTTP Request to Brokerage):
This is a high-confidence signal. The stock is technically oversold and has a fresh positive news catalyst.
Execute a buy order (with proper risk management, position sizing, etc.).
Send a notification: "Trade Executed: BUY $ABC @ $50. Reason: RSI Oversold + Positive News Catalyst."
